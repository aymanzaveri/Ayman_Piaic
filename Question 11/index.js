// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let message1 = "You are invited to my place";
console.log(names1[0] + " " + message1);
console.log(names1[1] + " " + message1);
console.log(names1[2] + " " + message1);
